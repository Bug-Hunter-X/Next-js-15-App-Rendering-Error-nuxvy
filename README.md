# Next.js 15 App Rendering Error

This repository demonstrates a common rendering error in Next.js 15 applications and how to solve it.

## Problem

A Next.js 15 application fails to render with a vague error message.  This is usually due to an issue with the application's structure or dependencies, which may not immediately be apparent in error logs.

## Solution

The solution may involve checking the following:

1. **Correct project setup:** Confirm the project was initialized and configured correctly with `create-next-app`.
2. **Dependencies:** Verify all dependencies are installed and compatible with Next.js 15.
3. **Code syntax:** Inspect the code for any syntax errors or typos.
4. **Build process:**  Check the Next.js build process and logs for any clues.
5. **Server-side rendering:** If using server-side rendering (SSR), ensure proper setup and data fetching.
6. **API routes:** If using API routes, verify their functionality and error handling.

This example provides a solution by ensuring a proper structure and handling of potential errors.
